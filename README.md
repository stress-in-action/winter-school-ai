# VU AI Winter School: Psychiatry Use Case

## General instruction
You have been divided into groups of approximately 5 people, each group gets assigned one of the two use cases (see document for your group and use case). We have taken into account your research domain/interests and other information you provided for putting together the groups.

You will be given a data set with some background information, and data analyses tasks/suggestions set at different levels of complexity. Over the course of the week, you will collaborate in your team to explore the provided use case and data set. At the end of the week, you will present your results in a short 5-10 minute pitch presentation. Here are some guidelines and suggestions for the group work and what to present:

-	You can work on parts individually or collaboratively, compare and discuss any outcomes, problems and solutions. The groups are mixed in terms of programming/machine learning skill and experience. Each use case has suggestions for different levels of expertise, so hopefully everyone can find something to work on. We absolutely encourage you to work together as well and share your expertise!
-	In addition to the technical work / data analysis, spend some time discussing how various topics addressed during the week might be relevant to the use case. Think about things such as responsible AI and adoption in clinical practice.
-	Do you have any insights from your own line of research that connect to aspects of the use case? Or, vice versa, did the use case give you any specific insights into your own research?
-	Feel free to find any related literature, examples etc. to get an broader understanding

During the 5-10 pitch presentation, one or two members of the group will present, using a few slides:
- the analysis results, your interpretation of them, any problems that arose and how you solved them
- discussion of other aspects such as practical implementation, and interesting connections to any of the topics discussed during the week

## Python

We prepared an iPython notebook for this use case. You can read it on this Github page or you can download it into the folder with the NESDA data we provided and rerun/modify the code you see there.
